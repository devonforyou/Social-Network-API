# Social-Network-API

## Description
For our 18th challenge of the course, we were tasked to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. For this application, I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
